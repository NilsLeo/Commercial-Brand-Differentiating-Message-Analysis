I still don't understand why you have unlimited with Verizon. Why wouldn't you switch all your lines to Sprint? What? I've analyzed the data. Sprint's network reliability is less than a 1% difference than Verizon's. Yet you choose to pay twice as much. I never thought of that. I never thought of that. Ha. Ha. We are laughing at your expense. Laughter. Laughter. Okay, guys, it wasn't that funny. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. You got a dumb face. So what made you switch? My co-workers are making fun of me. Ah. Stop paying twice as much for less than a 1% difference. Switch to Sprint.\n",

It's about what 5G will never do. 5G won't replace the courage it takes to run into the fire. It won't make the decision to become an officer any less selfless, or have any impact on what's required to put others' lives before your own. It can't take the place of bravery or substitute for compassion. It will never be the reason people make the choice to serve. 5G is going to change a lot of things.
